# CERA
Hi!

So, CERA is a plugin to QGIS that can assess coastal erosion risk, given that you give the appropriate input.

The plugin is still in development, and will continue to be on development for the future time, so, feedback is welcomed.

This is so early stage that I didn't even wrote a README properly, working on it! ;)

To install the plugin, click on the green button that says "Clone or Download" and download ZIP. Then you just have to copy "Cera" folder that is inside that zip file and add it to your "C:\Users\YOUR_USER \ .qgis2\python\plugins" folder. Start QGIS and it should be right there.

Once again dear coastal managers, try it, use it. I hope you enjoy :)

See U,
Pedro
